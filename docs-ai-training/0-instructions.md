# Process for Generating Condensed Training Data

This document outlines the process for generating a condensed, LLM-optimized version of training data.

## 1. Objective

The goal is to create and maintain a partial mirror of the `docs` directory in a directory named `docs-ai-training/`. This directory will contain a compact, fact-based version of (some) source `docs/` content, structured for an AI development partner. It should retain all essential technical information relevant to architectural planning, coding, and debugging.

## 2. Methodology: Mirrored Subtree Condensation

To ensure maintainability and efficiency, the process relies on creating a parallel, condensed version of the `docs` directory structure. Each included source file will have a corresponding condensed file in the `docs-ai-training` subtree. This approach keeps the condensed files organized and makes it trivial to locate the condensed version of any given source document.

When a source document is updated, only its mirrored file in `docs-ai-training` needs to be regenerated.

## 3. Source and Target Structure

The process operates on the source documents within the `docs/` directory and produces a mirrored output in `docs-ai-training/`.

-   **Source:** `docs/`
-   **Target:** `docs-ai-training/`

### Example Mapping:
-   `docs/Mesgjs-Language-Overview.md` -> `docs-ai-training/Mesgjs-Language-Overview.md`
-   `docs/interfaces/core.md` -> `docs-ai-training/interfaces/core.md`
-   `docs/command-line/msjscat.md` -> `docs-ai-training/command-line/msjscat.md`

## 4. Condensation Guidelines for AI

The following rules should be applied when transforming a source document into its counterpart in the `docs-ai-training` directory:

-   **Prioritize Facts Over Prose:** Retain technical specifications, API signatures, syntax rules, and configuration details. Remove lengthy introductions, narrative-style explanations, and redundant examples.
-   **Use Structure:** Employ markdown headings, lists, and tables to structure information for easy parsing.
-   **Extract Key Information:** For each function or interface, distill its purpose, full signature (parameters, return value, async, generator), and any critical side effects or usage notes.
-   **Be Concise:** Use clear, unambiguous language. Avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice. Don't add or include content that doesn't add value or isn't strictly required (examples: code samples and explanatory comments are perfectly reasonable, but don't use unnecessary white space if less still gets the job done). Compact efficiency takes priority over "prettiness" or "human readability" (as long as content accuracy can reasonably be verified visually) in this context.
-   **Preserve Code Examples:** Retain essential code snippets that demonstrate core functionality. Remove examples that are purely illustrative or repetitive.
-   **Maintain Header Context:** The beginning of each file should include a `Source:` entry, consisting of the original `docs/` document path, and a `Laat-condensed:` entry consisting of the `YYYY-MM-DD`-format date the condensed file was generated. These help identify portions of the content and its freshness when the individual parts are combined into a single, concatenated training-data file.
-   **Concatenation:** The final training-data result (generated by a user-run script) will be the concatenation of the condensed documentation components. It is critical that all files "end properly" (no unterminated code fences, for example) so that the following content does not begin from an improper state.

## 5. Task Execution Details

In the absence of directions regarding specific files to be added or updated, check `docs-ai-training/0-sources.md` for files that are expected to be included in the collection. The `0-` prefix is used to identify "meta files" (instructions, sources, scripts, concatenated output, etc). These files will be excluded from the compilation.
